<aside> But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing of a pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?</aside>

1. The purpose of HTML semantic tags is to give the browser and the developer additional information about the content of the element. Semantic tags have meaning as opposed to non-semantic tags like <div> or <span> which are arbitrary and don't give any information about what the element contains.  
2. It renders them in the order they are written in the file, from top to bottom 
3. Learning the snippets was useful.  Yes, I will probably make more snippets in the future! I also learned that lorem [tab] will produce lorem ipsum text in the editor, and that HTML is case sensitive.  
4. Making the snippet was difficult at first but after I made one, I understood how to do it. -->
