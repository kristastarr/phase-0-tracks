# Ask user to input data to answer your questions (use puts) 
# As the data is entered, convert it to the appropriate data type using ruby methods 
# Push or shovel all the responses into a hash
# Print the hash (use puts, print, or p?)
# Ask the user if they would like to update any of their responses or enter "none" (use a loop!)
# If they would like to update, they will type the name of the key and the program will take in the new data 
# and reassign it to the specified key 
# If the user enters "none" then break the loop
# If there are any changes, reprint the hash
