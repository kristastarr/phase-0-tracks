# Challenge 9.3 Notes 
## Research Plan

### Learning Approach/Types of Resources 
Because I am a visual learner and I like learn by doing, 
I plan to complete a Google search for JQuery resource in different formats, such as:
1. Articles/Tutorials
2. Infographics/"cheat sheets"
3. Videos 

For each resource that looks interesting, I will do a quick perusal to see if it seems like it will be helpful
I like to leave open tabs for several articles that look helpful, then read thoroughly through them one-by-one
Sometimes it helps me to take notes 
Sometimes as I read, I find new sub-topics which I need to look into further, which means another Google search

### Testing and Practicing
After I feel like I have a pretty good basic overview, I will bookmark the resources that seem most helpful 
Then I will plan to create a simple file to try and test out some of the things I have read about 
Once I have experimented to the point where I understand the concepts and how to use them in an actual project, I will go ahead and make the actual jQuery project. 


### Breaks 
I don't plan my breaks- I've gotten pretty good at recognizing when it's most productive for me to keep on going and when to take a break. I seem to work in spurts.
Sometimes if I am very focused and making great progress, I don't like to break my concentration, even if I've been working for quite awhile.  I can tell I'm losing focus when I start getting easily frustrated, or when I read and re-read things and they still don't make sense. At that point, it's usually a good idea to step back and do something to change my mental state so I can come back and work with more concentration. When my focus is good, I usually end up taking a break to stretch, walk around, get coffee, etc about once an hour.
