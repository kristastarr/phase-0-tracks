# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

Good morning :) 

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a useful tool that allows developers to create a timeline of their project and revert back to previous points on the timeline.  It allows several developers to make a copy of the original project so that different people can work on different features simultaneously without making any changes to the original and later merge them all with the master. It allows developers to track progress and create backups of their work. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of the master.  You would want to create a branch so you can work on a specific feature or modification without touching the original. That way if you do not like the changes you made or you mess something up in the branch, you will still be able to revert back to your "clean" master copy. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is when you save the specified changes to your branch.  A good commit message will be descriptive so if someone else reads your work, they will be able to tell what changes the commit is making, such as "update readme file to include whatever information" or "add feature xyz to homepage"

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when you are unable to merge branches to the master due to conflicts in the code in any of the branches
